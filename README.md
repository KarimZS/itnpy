# Inverse Text Normalization

A simple, deterministic, and extensible approach to [inverse text normalization](https://www.google.com/search?q=inverse+text+normalization) (ITN) for numbers.

## Overview

This package converts raw spoken-form text (speech recognition output) into user-friendly written-form text. It works best for converting spoken numbers into numerical digits, or other translation tasks that do not change word ordering. A [csv](https://github.com/Brandhsu/itnpy/blob/master/assets/vocab.csv) file is provided to define the basic rules for transforming spoken tokens into written tokens, and extra pre/post-processing may be applied for more specific formatting requirements, i.e. dates, measurements, money, etc.

## Issues

This package has been verified on a limited set of [test-cases](https://github.com/KarimZS/itnpy/tree/master/tests/assets/). For any translation mistakes, feel free to open a pull request and update [failing.csv](https://github.com/KarimZS/itnpy/blob/master/tests/assets/inverse_normalize_numbers/failing.csv) with the input, expected output, and mistake; thanks!
